Features
========

govuk_template Django template and static directory are included in the package. You can extend the GovUK Template directly

::

    {% extends 'govuk_template/base.html' %}


You can also download the latest govuk_template taball and extract the contentents to a directory of you choice

This will add the templates and static directories from the latest release of govuk_template to the directory passed as -d


You can include the default settings for all the included apps above by including the default settings in your app settings.py file

::

    from django_gov.settings import *


You can include the urls for the healthcheck endpoints

::

    url(r'^', include('django_gov.urls'))


Testing
=======

If you include the whole default settings, this will add flake8 code style tests to the directory you run your apps.

You can add a `setup.cfg` file containing your flake8 settings to the base directory of your app.

::

    [flake8]
    exclude = .git/,env/,venv/,node_modules/, manage.py
    max-complexity = 10
    max-line-length = 120
